Fractalizer Service
===================

## The Fractalizer Service
Powered by `league/fractal`, this bundle provides a service called
the `Fractalizer` that is in charge of fractalizing or normalizing a
resource (or a collection of resources) to leave them ready for
being casted into a Json, XML or YML representation. (But, for the love of 
APIs, just use Json).

You can use it in your controller with the `fractalize` method, or you
can fetch the service from the container, or injecting it in some other
service.

The fractalize method of the fractalizer takes three arguments: `$data`, which is
the data to be normalized; `$transformer`, which is an instance of the transformer
service for that kind of data; and `$resourceName`, which is just the resource name (lol).

It will automatically detect if your resource is a collection or not, and then
serialize it accordingly, including pagination if neccesary.

## `$data` DataTypes Supported
The `$data` argument can be one of the following types: a `QueryBuilder` object 
(useful for collections), an `ArrayCollection` object, a `PersistentCollection`, an
`array` containing objects or simply an `object` instance of one of your entities.

Any other DataType will cause the fractalizer to throw an Exception.

The fractalizer is closely related to the Fractal Manager, so you should definetely
check out the [documentation for fractal](https://fractal.thephpleague.com/glossary/).
