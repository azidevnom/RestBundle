The Rest Controller
===================

## Using the RestController
The Rest Controller is going to be your best friend for rapid API development. To
use it, simply make your controllers extend the `MNC\RestBundle\Controller\RestController`
class.

    <?php
    
    namespace App\Controller;
    
    use MNC\RestBundle\Controller\RestController;
    
    /**
     * Class PostController
     * @package App\Controller
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     * @Route("/posts")
     */
    class PostController extends RestController
    {
        
    }

Now, there's something very important `RestController` needs in order to work properly, and that is
the `@RestfulController` annotation. I will not work its magic for you if you don't
declare it. Let's do it!

    <?php
        
    namespace App\Controller;
    
    use MNC\RestBundle\Controller\RestController;
    use MNC\RestBundle\Annotation\RestfulController;
    
    /**
     * Class PostController
     * @package App\Controller
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     * @Route("/posts")
     * @RestfulController("post", 
     *     relatedEntity="CoreBundle\Entity\Post", 
     *     formClass="ApiBundle\Form\PostForm", 
     *     transformerClass="ApiBundle\Transformer\PostTransformer")
     */
    class PostController extends RestController
    {
        
    }
    
The `@RestfulController` annotation takes four string values, the first one being a simple
string that will define the **singular simple name of your resource**, and the last three
are some really important FQCNs (Fully Qualified Class Names).

If those three classes exist, then you will be ready to leverage all the power 
`RestController` has to offer you. Here is a summary of what they are:

- **relatedEntity**: This will be the FQCN of the entity associated with this resource. It is
necesary since it is used to call the Entity Repository. You can learn more about Doctrine entities
in the official documentation.
- **formClass**: This will be the FQCN of the form class used when creating and updating 
this entity/resource. You can learn about Symfony forms in the official documentation.
- **transformerClass**: This will be the FQCN of the transformer class. The transformer 
class is the class that contains all the logic to transform a in-memory php object 
representation of your resource (Entity) into an array that can be easily converted 
into a json string. This transformer has special habilities that you can learn reading 
the docs for the Entity Transformer.

Please keep the namespace of these classes consistent. They are not required to 
be the same in here in order for this library to work, but it is good practice 
to organize your namespaces this way.

## RestController Convinience Methods

### `CreateResourceResponse` method
There are some useful methods you get when using the RestController, the most
useful probably being `createResourceResponse($data, $statusCode, array $headers)`

This method is pure magic. Pass it some data, a status code and some custom headers 
if you want, and it will create a `JsonResponse` containing pagination (if multiple
records are to be listed) or a single resource. It works at it's best when you
pass it an instance of `QueryBuilder` that is ready to be fetched. This method
will make your life so easy when working with paginated collections in your api.

Basically, what this method contains is the following:
    
    // Calls the fractalizer service, passing the data and the transformer
    // asociated to that controller. 
    $array = $this->fractalize($data, $this->get($this->transformer));
    
    // Then, the normalized data is returned and casted into Json.
    return JsonResponse::create($array, $statusCode, $headers);
    
If you want to know more about the Fractalizer service, check the docs for the 
fractalizer. There's a lot going on in that service.
