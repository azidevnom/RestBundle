The Rest Controller
===================

## Using the RestController
The Rest Controller is going to be your best friend for rapid API development. To
use it, simply make your controllers extend the `MNC\RestBundle\Controller\RestController`
class.

    <?php
    
    namespace App\Controller;
    
    /**
     * Class PostController
     * @package App\Controller
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     * @Route("/posts")
     */
    class PostController extends RestController
    {
        
    }

Now, there's something very important `RestController` needs to work properly, and that is
the `@RestfulController` annotation. I will not work his magic for you if you don't
declare it. Let's do it!

    <?php
        
    namespace App\Controller;
    
    /**
     * Class PostController
     * @package App\Controller
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     * @Route("/posts")
     * @RestfulController("post", 
     *     relatedEntity="CoreBundle\Entity\Post", 
     *     formClass="ApiBundle\Form\PostForm", 
     *     transformerClass="ApiBundle\Transformer\PostTransformer")
     */
    class PostController extends RestController
    {
        
    }
    
The `@RestfulController` annotation takes four string values, the first one being a simple
string that will define the **singular simple name of your resource**, and the last three
are some really important FQCNs (Fully Qualified Class Names).

If those three classes exist, then you will be ready to leverage all the power 
`RestController` has to offer you. Here is a summary of what they are:

- **relatedEntity**: This will be the FQCN of the entity associated with this resource. It is
necesary since it is used to call the Entity Repository. You can learn more about Doctrine entities
in the official documentation.
- **formClass**: This will be the FQCN of the form class used when creating and updating 
this entity/resource. You can learn about Symfony forms in the official documentation.
- **transformerClass**: The transformer class is the class that contains all the logic
to transform a in-memory php object representation of your resource (Entity) into an
array that can be easily converted into a JsonObject. This transformer has special habilities
that you can learn reading the docs for the Entity Transformer.

Please keep the namespace of these classes consistent. They are not required to be the same
in here in order for this library to work, but it is good practice to organize your namespaces
this way.
