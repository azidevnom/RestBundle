Json Body Parser
================

## Parsing the Request Body
One of the utilities that this bundle provides by default is the ability to 
parse an `application/json` request body into request parameters. A listener does
this by checking the content type of request body.

The listener contains simple logic to work with a `application/json` request body.
If you send, for example, the following request body:

    {
    	"title": "Creating API in Symfony",
    	"subtitle": "The right way to do it",
    	"body": "Here is a guide for creating an API the right way.",
    	"publishedAt": {
    		"day": 1,
    		"month": 3,
    		"year": 2018
    	}
    }
    
Each key of this json will be put into the request parameters. So you will have a
parameter called `title`, another called `subtitle`, `body` and so on. Note that the
`publishedAt` is an array of three keys: `day`, `month` and `year`. These will not 
be a key on the request, rather, `publishedAt` will have the value of an array.

So, you will be able to fetch all the values using `$request->request->all()` or 
specific ones by using `$request->request->get('title')`.

If you don't like this feature, you can totally use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
to send your requests.
