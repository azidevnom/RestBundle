MNCRestBundle Documentation
===========================

There are many major parts to this bundle that you need to know about.

1. [The Rest Controller](1.rest-controller.md): This little guy will save you tons of work.
2. [Entity Transformers](2.entity-transformers.md): A middle man between your Entity Instances and your resources representation.
3. [Fractalizer](3.fractalizer.md): Your definitive solution to serialization/transformation (RIP JMS Serializer)
4. [Json Body Parser](4.json-body-parser.md): Because application/x-www-form-urlencoded sucks
5. [Api Problem (RFC 7807 Implementation)](5.api-problem.md): Because no one likes inconsistent error messages.
6. [The OwnableInterface](6.ownable-interface.md): An interface for protecting your resources.
7. [Json Schema Form Rendering](7.json-schema-forms.md): Because we need to be nice to our front devs.
8. [Advanced Fixtures](8.advanced-fixture.md): Some sugar for your doctrine fixtures.
