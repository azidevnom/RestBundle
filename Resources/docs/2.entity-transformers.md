Entity Transformers
===================

## Transformers in API Development
When you are building APIs, one of the most challenging tasks is to transform the
resources that you fetch from your database into a representation in a format that
your clients can consume. Of course, is not as simple as casting everything into
a json. Sometimes you need custom logic (based on the domain or business you are
working with) to hide/show fields, and to be selective on the hydration of your 
representations using very specific rules.

Entity Transformers are services that sit between your database and the 
representation you send to your clients. They are super important, because they
include the business rules that will determine what kind of representation your
client will recieve. We call this the transformation layer of your API. Some people
call it serialization.

This bundle relies on the popular `league/fractal` library to leverage a transformation
layer for your API, that is almost transparent to you.

> **For JMS Serializer Users**: If you have worked with Symfony before, maybe you are familiar with the magical
JSM Serializer. Although is a very powerful and widely used tool, is not recommended
for API serialization. It is true that you can hook into the serialization process using 
event listeners and that you can configure the hydration with a series of annotations, 
but that logic stays scattered around your code, and it's not very clean. Transformers 
are made so you encapsulate the serialization/transformation logic into one single 
class that is responsible for that. They are more reusable, and more testable.

## Creating a Transformer
To create a Transformer, simply create a `Transformer` directory in your project, and
create a class that extends `TransformerAbstract`. It is good practice to name this 
transformer with the name of your entity, and the word `Transformer` after it.

    <?php
    
    namespace App\Transformer;
    
    use App\Entity\Post;
    use DateTime;
    use League\Fractal\TransformerAbstract;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AuthorizationCheckerInterface;
    
    /**
     * Class PostTransformer
     * @package App\Transformer
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     */
    class PostTransformer extends TransformerAbstract
    {    
        /**
         * @param Post $post
         * @return array
         */
        public function transform(Post $post)
        {
            return [
                'id' => $post->getId(),
                'slug' => $post->getSlug(),
                'title' => $post->getTitle(),
                'subtitle' => $post->getSubtitle(),
                'body' => $post->getBody(),
                'publication_date' => $post->getPublishedAt()->format(DateTime::ATOM),
                'is_published' => $post->isPublished(),
            ];
        }
    }
    
The one and only method you need to implement is the `transform` method, that will
receieve an instance of your entity. In there, you must define the logic to return an
array of your serialized entity. Don't include any fields that are part of a ORM
relationship. We will deal with those in a different way.

## Hydrating the Transformer
Object hydration, or the art of including subresources into a representation, 
is one of the most challenging tasks of API development. Fortunatelly, hydration
using transformers is easy.

In this bundle, the responsability of selecting the hydration of a certain resource
lies in the api client. Using the reserved `with` query param, you will be telling
to the `Fractalizer` to fetch the main resource with the specific resource embedded
into the response payload.

For example, `/api/posts?with=author` will return the following:

    {
        "data": [
            {
                "id": 3,
                "slug": "illum-voluptatum-nemo-asperiores-eos-totam",
                "title": "Illum voluptatum nemo asperiores eos totam.",
                "subtitle": "Nesciunt magnam sunt voluptatem laboriosam ipsa officia eveniet neque deserunt enim.",
                "body": "Et eveniet animi quibusdam nihil inventore soluta. Ducimus corporis commodi cumque possimus explicabo in minima. Et asperiores eveniet esse earum quas.\n\nMolestiae quasi autem veritatis ipsa. Et unde recusandae maiores velit in. Molestiae nemo beatae saepe voluptas aut est sint dolorum. Eaque nesciunt quod cum.\n\nNon voluptatum velit officiis. Et dolores et ut laboriosam non. Itaque aut quam molestiae rerum occaecati asperiores commodi. Quisquam ullam id deleniti cum est cum dolores.\n\nEt in dicta qui quia. Delectus hic ea temporibus quasi est sequi illum. Hic illum ut repudiandae laboriosam.\n\nAt velit officia vitae non in quia. Nemo vero sit minima. Non nostrum ad repudiandae ab nulla. Et officia molestiae voluptatem nobis error.\n\nAperiam odit omnis ullam numquam. Est aut ducimus nihil quia et qui. Impedit ullam voluptate ad asperiores et. Quis praesentium ea ex voluptatem suscipit numquam doloremque.\n\nCumque fugit eligendi nobis autem. Sint quia enim omnis natus eaque veritatis et. Occaecati sequi rem exercitationem eveniet voluptas. Id voluptatem amet quos iusto beatae suscipit corrupti.",
                "publication_date": "2019-01-19T20:07:22-04:00",
                "is_published": true,
                "author": {
                    "data": {
                        "id": 6,
                        "name": "Soledad Conn",
                        "email": "lucile.funk@example.com",
                        "member_since": "2018-02-16T19:51:32-04:00"
                    }
                }
            },
            // Other 9 resources...
        ],
        "meta": {
            "pagination": {
                "total": 21,
                "count": 10,
                "per_page": 10,
                "current_page": 1,
                "total_pages": 3,
                "links": {
                    "next": "http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/posts?with=author&page=2"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Notice that the author resource appears embedded in the response namespaced with a `data` key,
and then the actual records. This works this way, so you can have a `meta` namespace
for that resource as well.

In order to include subresources this way, you must define the `$availableIncludes`
property and the `include{Resource}` method in your transformer, like this:

    <?php
        
    namespace App\Transformer;
    
    use App\Entity\Post;
    use DateTime;
    use League\Fractal\TransformerAbstract;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AuthorizationCheckerInterface;
    
    /**
     * Class PostTransformer
     * @package App\Transformer
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     */
    class PostTransformer extends TransformerAbstract
    {
        protected $availableIncludes = ['author'];
    
        /**
         * @param Post $post
         * @return array
         */
        public function transform(Post $post)
        {
            return [
                'id' => $post->getId(),
                'slug' => $post->getSlug(),
                'title' => $post->getTitle(),
                'subtitle' => $post->getSubtitle(),
                'body' => $post->getBody(),
                'publication_date' => $post->getPublishedAt()->format(DateTime::ATOM),
                'is_published' => $post->isPublished(),
            ];
        }
    
        /**
         * @param Post $post
         * @return \League\Fractal\Resource\Item
         */
        public function includeAuthor(Post $post)
        {
            return $this->item($post->getAuthor(), UserTransformer::class);
        }
    }
    
Note the `item` method inside `includeAuthor`. Since a Post object only has one 
author, the include will always return an item. But, let's pretend that you have
another entity call `Comment`, and that a `Post` will have many of those. In this
case, you add the key `post` to the array `$availableIncludes` property, and define
the include method like this:

    /**
     * @param Post $post
     * @return \League\Fractal\Resource\Item
     */
    public function includeAuthor(Post $post)
    {
        return $this->collection($post->getComments(), CommentTransformer::class);
    }
    
Then, you will be able to embed both relationhips using the `with` query param, just
separating them with a comma:

    /api/posts?with=author,comments

Ah, and you can embed subresources of subresources too, using a simple dot. Let's
also embed the author of a comment!

    /api/posts?with=author,comments.author

Easy peasy lemon squeezy!

## About Eager Loading
By default Doctrine will lazy load your includes, but you eager load them if you
set the following config in your bundle configuration:

    mnc_rest:
        eager_load_includes: true; # default is false

For every resource in your `with` query param, this bundle will try to create a
join and add a select to fetch them from your db in a full query. This feature is 
highly experimenta though, and not really well tested. Use it with care.

## Injecting Services in Your Transformers
Your transformers are services, and as with any Symfony service, you can perform
Constructor DI into them, passing them any service that you might need to adjust
the serialization process to meet your business needs.

A useful one, for example, would be Symfony's Authorization checker. We can hide
some fields based on if a user has a certain role. Let's hide the `id` of a post
from any user that is not an admin.

    <?php
        
    namespace App\Transformer;
    
    use App\Entity\Post;
    use DateTime;
    use League\Fractal\TransformerAbstract;
    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Authorization\AuthorizationCheckerInterface;
    
    /**
     * Class PostTransformer
     * @package App\Transformer
     * @author Matías Navarro Carter <mnavarro@option.cl>
     */
    class PostTransformer extends TransformerAbstract
    {
        protected $availableIncludes = ['author'];
    
        /**
         * @var AuthorizationCheckerInterface
         */
        private $authChecker;
    
        public function __construct(AuthorizationCheckerInterface $authChecker)
        {
            $this->authChecker = $authChecker;
        }
    
        /**
         * @param Post $post
         * @return array
         */
        public function transform(Post $post)
        {
            $data = [];
            if ($this->authChecker->isGranted('ROLE_ADMIN')) {
                $data['id'] = $post->getId();
            }
            $data['slug'] = $post->getSlug();
            $data['title'] = $post->getTitle();
            $data['subtitle'] = $post->getSubtitle();
            $data['body'] = $post->getBody();
            $data['publication_date'] = $post->getPublishedAt()->format(DateTime::ATOM);
            $data['is_published'] = $post->isPublished();
            
            return $data;
        }
    
        /**
         * @param Post $post
         * @return \League\Fractal\Resource\Item
         */
        public function includeAuthor(Post $post)
        {
            return $this->item($post->getAuthor(), UserTransformer::class);
        }
    }
    
I think that that's a good deal with the transformers. For more detailed usage and
features, you should check the [fractal package docs](https://fractal.thephpleague.com/transformers/).
